--- Adds a handler for changes to a state bag.
--- 
--- The function called expects to match the following signature:
--- 
--- ```ts
--- function StateBagChangeHandler(bagName: string, key: string, value: any, reserved: number, replicated: boolean);
--- ```
--- 
--- *   **bagName**: The internal bag ID for the state bag which changed. This is usually `player:Source`, `entity:NetID`
--- 
---     or `localEntity:Handle`.
--- *   **key**: The changed key.
--- *   **value**: The new value stored at key. The old value is still stored in the state bag at the time this callback executes.
--- *   **reserved**: Currently unused.
--- *   **replicated**: Whether the set is meant to be replicated.
--- 
--- At this time, the change handler can't opt to reject changes.

--- 
--- Needs working example. Doesn't seem to do anything.
--- 
--- I marked p2 as targetVehicle as all these shooting related tasks seem to have that in common.
--- 
--- I marked p6 as distanceToShoot as if you think of GTA's Logic with the native SET_VEHICLE_SHOOT natives, it won't shoot till it gets within a certain distance of the target.
--- 
--- I marked p7 as pedAccuracy as it seems it's mostly 100 (Completely Accurate), 75, 90, etc. Although this could be the ammo count within the gun, but I highly doubt it. I will change this comment once I find out if it's ammo count or not.

---
