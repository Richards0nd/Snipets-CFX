--- Example usage  
--- VEHICLE::GET_CLOSEST_VEHICLE(x, y, z, radius, hash, unknown leave at 70)   
--- x, y, z: Position to get closest vehicle to.  
--- radius: Max radius to get a vehicle.  
--- modelHash: Limit to vehicles with this model. 0 for any.  
--- flags: The bitwise flags altering the function's behaviour.  
--- Does not return police cars or helicopters.  
--- It seems to return police cars for me, does not seem to return helicopters, planes or boats for some reason  
--- Only returns non police cars and motorbikes with the flag set to 70 and modelHash to 0. ModelHash seems to always be 0 when not a modelHash in the scripts, as stated above.   
--- These flags were found in the b617d scripts: 0,2,4,6,7,23,127,260,2146,2175,12294,16384,16386,20503,32768,67590,67711,98309,100359.  
--- Converted to binary, each bit probably represents a flag as explained regarding another native here: gtaforums.com/topic/822314-guide-driving-styles  
--- Conversion of found flags to binary: pastebin.com/kghNFkRi  
--- At exactly 16384 which is 0100000000000000 in binary and 4000 in hexadecimal only planes are returned.   
--- It's probably more convenient to use worldGetAllVehicles(int *arr, int arrSize) and check the shortest distance yourself and sort if you want by checking the vehicle type with for example VEHICLE::IS_THIS_MODEL_A_BOAT  
--- -------------------------------------------------------------------------  
--- Conclusion: This native is not worth trying to use. Use something like this instead: pastebin.com/xiFdXa7h
--- Use flag 127 to return police cars

function GetClosestVehicle(x,y,z,radius,modelHash,flags) end

--- Returns model name of vehicle in all caps. Needs to be displayed through localizing text natives to get proper display name.
--- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--- While often the case, this does not simply return the model name of the vehicle (which could be hashed to return the model hash). Variations of the same vehicle may also use the same display name.
--- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--- Returns "CARNOTFOUND" if the hash doesn't match a vehicle hash.
--- Using HUD::_GET_LABEL_TEXT, you can get the localized name.

--- According to decompiled scripts this should work with the `deluxo` and `oppressor2` vehicles.
--- I've only seen this work for `deluxo` though, can't figure out what it's supposed to do on `oppressor2`.
--- 
--- For the deluxo:
--- 
--- *   Set `state` to `0.0`: Fully transform to a 'road' vehicle (non-hover mode).
--- *   Set `state` to `1.0`: Fully transform to a 'flying' vehicle (hover mode).
--- 
--- If you set it to something like 0.5, then something [weird happens](https://streamable.com/p6wmr), you end up in some 50% hover mode, 50% not hover mode.
--- 
--- This doesn't need to be called every tick, just once and the vehicle will transform to that state at the usual transform speed. It'll just stop transforming when it reaches the state you provided.
--- 
--- Once this native is used then players will just be able to hit the vehicle transform key to toggle the transformation cycle; it won't block users from using the key.
