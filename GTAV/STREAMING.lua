--- 	SWITCH_TYPE_AUTO,  
--- 	SWITCH_TYPE_LONG,  
--- 	SWITCH_TYPE_MEDIUM,

--- };  
--- Use GET_IDEAL_PLAYER_SWITCH_TYPE for the best switch type. Or just auto, because it calls the same function in executable.  
--- ----------------------------------------------------  
--- Examples from the decompiled scripts:  
--- STREAMING::START_PLAYER_SWITCH(l_832._f3, PLAYER::PLAYER_PED_ID(), 0, 3);  
--- STREAMING::START_PLAYER_SWITCH(l_832._f3, PLAYER::PLAYER_PED_ID(), 2050, 3);  
--- STREAMING::START_PLAYER_SWITCH(PLAYER::PLAYER_PED_ID(), l_832._f3, 1024, 3);  
--- STREAMING::START_PLAYER_SWITCH(g_141F27, PLAYER::PLAYER_PED_ID(), 513, v_14);  
--- Note: DO NOT, use SWITCH_TYPE_LONG with flag 513. It leaves you stuck in the clouds. You'll have to call STOP_PLAYER_SWITCH() to return to your ped.  
--- Flag 8 w/ SWITCH_TYPE_LONG will zoom out 3 steps, then zoom in 2/3 steps and stop on the 3rd and just hang there.  
--- Flag 8 w/ SWITCH_TYPE_MEDIUM will zoom out 1 step, and just hang there.
